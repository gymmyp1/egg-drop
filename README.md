# Lab 1: Egg Drop (C++ Edition)

## ü•ö Overview

This lab involves writing a C++ program that determines whether an egg will break when dropped from a building, based on the height of the fall and gravitational acceleration.

You will:
- Prompt the user to enter the height of a building in meters.
- Use physics to calculate the time it takes for the egg to fall.
- Determine if the egg will break based on that time.
- Display the result, matching the expected output format exactly.

---

## üìö Background

To compute the time it takes for the egg to fall, use the following physics formula for free fall (ignoring air resistance): t = ‚àö(2h / g)

Where:
- `t` is the time in seconds,
- `h` is the height in meters,
- `g` is the gravitational constant (9.8 m/s¬≤).

If the **time exceeds 2.00 seconds**, the egg will break.

## ‚úÖ Program Requirements

- Prompt the user for the building height (in meters).
- Calculate fall time using the formula above.
- Print the time to exactly **2 decimal places**.
- If time > 2.00 seconds ‚Üí print: `"The egg will break!"`
- If time ‚â§ 2.00 seconds ‚Üí print: `"The egg will not break!"`
- Output should match the example exactly (formatting matters).

## üí° Example Executions

```bash
Enter the height of the building in meters: 20
Time to fall: 2.02 seconds
The egg will break!
```
```bash
Enter the height of the building in meters: 5
Time to fall: 1.01 seconds
The egg will not break!
```

> ‚úÖ To earn full credit, make sure your program produces the correct result **and** is cleanly written with helpful comments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation and Execution

To compile your code:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
To run your program:

```bash
./main
```

üßµ Tips
- Use #include <cmath> for sqrt().
- Use std::fixed and std::setprecision(2) from <iomanip> for decimal formatting.
- Your code should adapt to any numeric input. The sample executions are a good place to start, but don't test ONLY those cases.
- Be sure your output formatting matches the sample exactly, including spacing and punctuation.
